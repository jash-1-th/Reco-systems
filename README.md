For whatever we buy or travel to a new place, the recommendation system is inescapable. Restaurants also
require recommendation systems in order to attract more customers from the management side and to allow consumers
to sample preferred, well-known dishes in the restaurant. Finding preferred and well-known foods, especially in a new
region, is a difficult endeavor. We offer a restaurant recommendation system based on rating distribution and other
(ambience, service etc) rating distribution calculated using the matrix density in this article. In addition, we created a
popularity-based recommender model for customers to use when making restaurant recommendations. Our technique
firstly distributes the data, then uses TF-IDF Vectorization to analyse. Finally, the model's output includes 10
recommendations for the most popular restaurants and meal items offered by the relevant restaurant.
Modern recommendation systems/paradigms for restaurants are not very personalized and human in nature and rather
are highly dependent on data and statistics, rather than feedback from unbiased customers.
